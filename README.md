# NativeJournal - A React Native Project
The goal of this project was for me to develop an understanding of how to connect a React.js website to native devices. React Native is a simple solution to this problem, and has proven to be very powerful.

> Currently, this project is still a WIP

### TO DO:
- [x] Set up ReactNative app
- [ ] Fix FirebaseAuthUI Login
- [ ] Bundle iOS and Android apps for offline testing/distribution
- [ ] Upload to TestFlight and compare TestFlight v.s. FirebaseAnalytics
